Hi! This is a small repository that I'm using for my Operating Systems class on my university.
In it, there are a few files for exercise 4:
hash_script.fish is a fish shell script that reads a 4-digit number and outputs an SHA-256 hash of the number.
hash_output.txt is a text file that contains the SHA-256 hash of the last 4 digits of my personal ID number on my department (ΑΕΜ in Greek!).
